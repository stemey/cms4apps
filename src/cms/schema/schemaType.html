<div>
	<p>defines the schema and the layout of the editor. \n There are three strategies for adding a schema:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>no schema - The editor will be a json editor.</li>
		<li>single schema - each document in the collection has the same schema.</li>
		<li>multiple schemas - each document has a type property identifying its schema.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<h4>Please consider</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Once a multiple-schema collection has been populated changes to the typeProperty will need to be accompanied
			by migration of the existing documents. That is currently not handled by this tool.
		</li>
		<li>
			If a document was altered outside of this tool and does not conform to its schema, then it might not be
			loaded by the editor. You need to either modify the schema or open the document with the fallback editor (use context menu in the table view).
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</div>
