<div>
	<p>There is more than one schema in the collection. The schema of a document is defined by the value of the typeProperty.</p>
	<h4>Please consider</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Once a multiple-schema collection has been populated changes to the typeProperty will need to be accompanied
			by migration of the existing documents. That is currently not handled by this tool.
		</li>
		<li>
			If a document was altered outside of this tool and does not conform to its schema, then it might not be
			loaded by the editor. You need to either modify the schema or open the document with the fallback editor (use context menu in the table view).
		</li>
	</ul>
