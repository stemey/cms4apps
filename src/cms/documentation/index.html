<h2>Views</h2>
<p class="image"><img src="assets/ViewMenu.png"/><br/><span class="caption">The view menu</span></p>
<p>

	Each collection has its own view. Views can differ greatly but a usual collection's view consist of a master view
	(e.g. a grid) to browse
	the collection's documents and a detail view (editor) displaying the details of a selected document. Views are accessed by a
	dropdown in the toolbar. There four general views for documentation, collection, databases and schemas. All collection
	views are grouped in submenus corresponding to their database.

<h2>Grid</h2>
<p>
	Most Grids provide sorting by clicking on the column header. Querying is supported by either a simple textfield or
	a query editor. The query editor supports two modes. You may enter a query as json in a structured text editor.
	Alternatively you can click the query button and use the visual query editor.
	context menu.

<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>
	store and document view are bookmarkable. A document may be selected from the master view or by following a link from
	another document. Select the document will automatically open the corresponding master view on the left. Documents
	are displayed in a tab container. his makes it easy to display linked document and switch between documents quickly.
</p>

<h2>Collection View</h2>
<p>
	<p>The Collection view displays the metadata for the mongodb collections. The list of metadata includes:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>name</li>
	<li>description</li>
	<li>whether or not the primary key maybe assigned by the user</li>
	<li>the schema or detail editor ui</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	A collection can have one or more schemas associated with it. The purpose of the schema is to guide the user in editing
	documents by providing a sophisticated detail editor.
	Either there is a single schema for all documents in the
	collection or each document contains a property that serves as type discriminator - often called type property.
	Schemas are stored separately and it is possible to compose schemas by reference, so that even a recursive schema
	structure representing a tree model is possible.
	</p>

	The following operations are available:
	<ul>
		<li>create a new collection (toolbar)</li>
		<li>delete collection and its metadata</li>
		<li>jump to the data view of the selected collection</li>
		<li>generate schema information by sampling exiting data</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Generating the schema is a very useful feature if there is an existing collection containing documents. The
	generation dialog ask the suer to specify the number of documents to sample and a optionally the name of the
	typeProperty. Restricting the number of samples will yield a faster generation process but may produce a less
	exact result. The typeProperty maybe specified if one exists. A typeProperty is a property whose value is interpreted
	as a type discriminator. There will be a distinct schemas for each value of the property. If the documents in the collection
	were created by a Mapping library in a statically typed OO-language (e.g. Morphia or spring data for Java) then the name of the class
	will most likely be stored in the typeProperty.

<h2>Schema View</h2>
<p>
	Schemas are stored separate from the collections.
</p>

<h2>DB View</h2>
<p>
	The list of dbs provides information about their size on disk. The details include the list of collections.
	The operations available on a single db include the creation of a new collection and the synchronization between
	the actual db's collections and the collections stored in the metadata store. When starting the app these two will be synchronized
	automatically. If a new collection is created in the db while this app is running then this new collection will not be
	displayed until a synchronization is performed.
