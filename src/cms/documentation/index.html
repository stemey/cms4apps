	Each collection has its own view. Views can differ greatly but a usual collection's view consist of a master view
	(e.g. a grid) to browse
	the collection's documents and a detail view (editor) displaying the details of a selected document. Views are accessed by a
	dropdown in the toolbar. There four general views for documentation, collection, databases and schemas. All collection
	views are grouped in submenus corresponding to their database.

	Most Grids provide sorting by clicking on the column header. Querying is supported by either a simple textfield or
	a query editor. The query editor supports two modes. You may enter a query as json in a structured text editor.
	Alternatively you can click the query button and use the visual query editor.

	another document. Select the document will automatically open the corresponding master view on the left. Documents
	are displayed in a tab container. his makes it easy to display linked document and switch between documents quickly.
