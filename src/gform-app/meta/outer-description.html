<p>
    the outer option reverses the relation between page and embedded.<br>
    The page is rendered as an embedded called inner of the template-ref.<br>
    The outer template must look like this:
    <pre><code lang="html">
    ..
    {{#inner}}
      {{>inner}}
    {{/inner}}
    ..
    </code></pre>
    <strong>Limitation</strong>:<br>
    outer can only be used to wrap a page not an embedded.<br>
    Also there may only be one per page.
