<h3>stores</h3>
<p>
    this view displays all stores.<br>
    stores can be added, removed and modified at runtime.<br>
    The entities in a store must conform with one of the store's schemas.<br>
    A store may be associated with one or more schemas.<br>
    In the latter case each entity in the store must provide the id of<br>
    its schema in a property called 'typeProperty'
