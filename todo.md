opener:
- when tab is opened with new entity, then saving, then opening again, a new tab is opened because id has chaged.

template editor:

add url 
remove "_type"
add groups that lazily create subforms for constraints.
make code be the laelAttribute

ref editor:

if no schemaUrl then don't show add/edit buttons
we need to add extra parameter to filter on pages (like template). 

performance:
-lazy form creation:
-- titlepane
-- many type widget


hooks for editor:
- initialize entity befre creation/loading


opener:
- add ActionClasses, CrudControllerClass
